# COMP2310 Assignment 2

This is the assignment repository for your second assignment. 

Do not modify the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file as the results of your CI will be used to generate grades. 

Tampering with this file will be noticed and may result in academic misconduct. 

For more information, [read the assessment page](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2310/assessments/02-atc/).

Before starting to code, we recommend reading through the source code you are
provided with so you don't accidentally end up re-implementing something we
already wrote for you!
